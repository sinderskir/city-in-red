#A City in Red - The Geography of Sexual Violence in NYC
This is a project for the 2023 Lede Program at Columbia University. I mapped rape cases per precinct in NYC using <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/crime-statistics-landing.page">NYPD</a> data from 2023.

##Data
The project was built on New York Police Department databases, considering cases of rape reported between January 1 and June 25, 2023. The data on NYC and boroughs' population are from <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC OpenData</a>. General statistics about sexual violence are from the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">RAINN</a>.

##Limitations
Discussing rape/sexual violence means dealing with underreporting. Besides, the NYPD doesn't disclose more specific statistics on the cases, victims, and aggressors, limiting the analysis to the number of cases.

##Next steps
The following steps include using other databases to analyze sociodemographic data of precincts and boroughs. I also intend to map data related to different types of crimes and consider other forms of sexual violence besides rape. It would be very interesting to display the number of police officers in each precinct to see if this variable is related to the number of sexual crimesâ€”a smaller police force = more violence. Still, I couldn't find the database for it.
